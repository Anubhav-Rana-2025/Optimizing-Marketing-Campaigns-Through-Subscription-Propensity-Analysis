Look at that gorgeous little moon, look at the care that went into that. The dosa, my god, was grand. I was happy with the chutneys until this banana leaf steamed branzino came out with this coconut sauce from heaven and then the chutneys suddenly seemed bland and dead to me. That's the risk in a place like this I guess, you make things too fabulous they're gonna outshine the other fabulous things. I'd recommend getting the fish with coconut rice, should've done, with the coconut sauce it's a beautiful curry. The staff were kind, warm and attentive, made it a great experience. I just feel bad for my mom, I took her here forgetting about her, shall we say, delicate spice tolerance.
